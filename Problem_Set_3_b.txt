Flask is often chosen when you prefer a lightweight and minimalistic framework for small or simple projects, allowing for customization and flexibility in project structure and implementation, ideal for RESTful APIs and learning purposes.

Django, on the other hand, is favored for rapid development of complex applications with its "batteries included" approach, providing a comprehensive set of features and conventions, especially suitable for projects with complex database relationships, built-in admin interface needs, and scalability requirements.

Flask is great for smaller, custom projects with specific needs, while Django shines in larger-scale projects that require quick development, convention-based workflows, and extensive built-in functionalities.
